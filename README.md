# Website for a personal Emby Data Check Tool - Version "Angular & Bootstrap"

This project contains the website for checking the data and status stored in a personal Emby Server. Please visit the website [emby.media](https://emby.media/) for reading more details about Emby Server. The project uses the Web UI framework of [Angular](https://angular.io/) in conjunction with the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) UI framework.

_Remark_: There is also a [parallel repository](https://github.com/jfandy1982/emby-data-check-ui-angular-material), which tries to achieve the same by using the Angular Material framework instead of the Bootstrap framework.

The website uses the REST-based API as implemented in my repository [Emby Data Check Backend](https://github.com/jfandy1982/emby-data-check-backend).
